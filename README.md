This is my Module 2 Interactive Device Project for Creative Embedded Systems with Prof. Tiffany Tseng (Fall 2024). My Module 2 project is a visual reflex test that utilizes the joystick to stop a moving image on a screen when it matches up with the other half. It is a simple image matching game that uses a joystick and button to help children and elderly people with their fine motor skills.
